                <h5 class="w3-center">Hyper Text Markup language</h5>
                <p class="w3-large">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents
                    designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It
                    is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such
                    as JavaScript.

                    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects
                    such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
                    structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
                    links, quotes, and other items. <span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey">HTML</span></p>
                <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language
                    such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS
                    defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of
                    the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
                    presentational HTML since 1997.</p>

                <h4>CasCading Style Sheet</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including
                    layout, colors, and fonts.</p><br>

                <h4>Declaration</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">Each declaration itself consists of a property, a colon (:), and a value.
                    Optional white-space may be around the declaration block, declarations, colons, and semi-colons for
                    readability.</p><br>

                <h4>paseudo-classes</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on
                    information that is not contained in the document tree.</p><br>

                <h4>Properties</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">Properties are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has a set of
                    possible values. Some properties can affect any type of element, and others apply only to particular
                    groups of elements.</p><br>

                <h4>Values</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">Values may be keywords, such as "center" or "inherit", or numerical values, such
                    as 200px (200 pixels), 50vw (50 percent of the viewport width) or 80% (80 percent of the parent
                    element's width).</p>

                    <p class="w3-large">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the
                        Java language project in June 1991.Java was originally designed for interactive television,
                        but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.The language
                        was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the
                        project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee
                        from Indonesia.Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application
                        programmers would find familiar.</p>
